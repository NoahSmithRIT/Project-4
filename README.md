# Project-4

Description: 
I will be doing three versions of tic-tac-toe. The first will be a basic game of tic-tac-toe using JQuery, along with some animation. The next version will also be a basic game of tic-tac-toe, but will include multiple options for changing the way the game looks. This will be done with either buttons or a drop-down menu. The third will be a game of ultimate tic-tac-toe. In ultimate tic-tac-toe there are nine “local boards” arranged on one “global board”. Play starts in the middle and wherever a turn is taken indicates what local board is played in next. For example, if an X is placed in the local top right from the middle global board section, the O must be placed somewhere in the local board of the top right section of the global board. The goal is to get tic-tac-toe on the global board. I will have to include some way for the players to know what board is active, probably by changing the background color of that board. I am not sure if I can make an ultimate tic-tac-toe board, I may have to reconsider the last page. Materialize will be used as a framework for the webpages that the tic-tac-toe boards will be on.

Partners: Working by myself

What I will need to learn: 
I will need to learn how to use one or more JavaScript libraries for the animation. Currently this will be Animate.css for simpler animations and I will likely use Anime.js for any custom animation. I will also need to learn more about JQuery to be able to make a working game of tic-tac-toe.

Changes to the project apart from what was described in the description:
The first version is just a basic version of tic-tac-toe. The third page was going to have an AI opponenet instead of being a game of ultimate tic-tac-toe. Although I did not have time to do the last page, so it is the same as the first. Also, Materialize was not compatible with the tic-tac-toe board as they both use the "row" and "col" classes, so I switched to using flexbox for the layout of the pages.
